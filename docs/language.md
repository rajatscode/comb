# Comb Language Reference

Comb is a UI framework built on a discrete event simulation execution model. `.comb` files declare signals, derived values, state transitions, and views — the compiler extracts a static dependency graph (`__graph`), verifies it, and emits readable JavaScript.

---

## Primitives

### signal — mutable state

```sv
signal count = 0;
signal name = "";
signal price: float = 9.99;
```

Type annotations are optional — the type is inferred from the initial value. Explicit types (`signal x: int = 0;`) are still supported and enable compile-time type checking (warnings).

Signals can only be written inside `always` blocks using `<=`, `++`, `--`, `+=`, or `-=`:

```sv
always @(increment) {
  count++;           // sugar for count <= count + 1
  score += 10;       // sugar for score <= score + 10
}
```

### comb — derived value

```sv
comb doubled = count * 2;
comb label = "Count: " + str(count);
comb isValid = len(name) >= 3 && contains(email, "@");
```

Combs are pure derivations. The compiler statically extracts all dependencies and verifies they exist. All branches are tracked (static union semantics) — even inside ternaries, both sides are registered as deps.

### always @(event) — event-triggered block

```sv
always @(increment) {
  count <= count + 1;
}

always @(reset) {
  count <= 0;
  name <= "";
}
```

Fires when the named event is triggered (e.g. from a button `@click`). Writes use `<=` (non-blocking assignment — scheduled for end of current delta). Multiple writes in one block are atomic via `batch()`.

### always @(signal, ...) — sensitivity-triggered block

```sv
always @(celsius) {
  fahrenheit <= celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;
}

always @(width, height) {
  area <= width * height;
}
```

Auto-fires when any declared signal changes. The compiler **verifies** the sensitivity list: every signal read inside the block must be declared in the `@(...)` list. An undeclared read is a compile error. Self-triggering writes (writing to a signal you're sensitive to) are also caught.

### always @(posedge/negedge) — edge-triggered block

```sv
// Fires ONCE when loading transitions false → true
always @(posedge loading) {
  showSpinner();
}

// Fires ONCE when loading transitions true → false
always @(negedge loading) {
  fadeInContent();
}

// Fires when error count transitions from 0 to >0
always @(posedge len(errors) > 0) {
  showToast("Errors detected");
}
```

Edge-triggered sensitivity fires on *transitions*, not values. `@(posedge x)` fires when `x` becomes true (rising edge). `@(negedge x)` fires when `x` becomes false (falling edge). This is a common UI need ("do something when X *becomes* true") that's awkward with standard reactivity — React's `useEffect` is level-triggered, requiring manual `usePrevious` patterns.

Edge-triggered blocks compile end-to-end. The mechanism exists in other frameworks (MobX `when()`, RxJS `pairwise()`), but not as a compiled, compiler-verified language construct.

### edgeCount / negedgeCount — reactive event counting

```sv
comb alertCount = edgeCount(cpuHigh) + edgeCount(memHigh);
```

`edgeCount(expr)` returns a reactive value that automatically increments each time `expr` transitions false→true. No manual counter signal needed — the count is derived from event history. `negedgeCount(expr)` counts true→false transitions.

### changeCount — reactive value-change counting

```sv
comb completed = changeCount(writeback_out);
comb totalMoves = changeCount(selectedCell);
```

`changeCount(signal)` returns a reactive value that increments each time `signal`'s value changes to a *different* value. Unlike `edgeCount` which only counts boolean false→true transitions, `changeCount` counts every value change — integers, strings, objects, etc. Useful for counting events in pipelines, state machine transitions, or any case where you need to know how many times a value was updated.

### view — reactive DOM

```sv
view {
  <div class="counter">
    <h1>{label}</h1>
    <p class={isValid ? "valid" : "invalid"}>{message}</p>
    <button @click=increment>+</button>
    <input @bind=name />
    @if (count > 10) { <p>High!</p> }
    @for item in items { <li>{item}</li> }
  </div>
}
```

`{expr}` — reactive text interpolation. `@click=event` — event binding. `@bind=signal` — two-way input binding. `@if`/`@for` — conditional and list rendering. `class={expr}` — dynamic attributes. No virtual DOM — effects directly patch DOM nodes.

Keyed list rendering with efficient reconciliation:
```sv
@for item in items key=item.id {
  <div>{item.name}</div>
}
```

---

## Assertions

```sv
assert always (count >= 0);
assert canSubmit == (usernameValid && emailValid);
```

Runtime invariants registered as nodes in the `__graph`. The test harness auto-evaluates assertions across generated input combinations.

### Temporal assertions

Inspired by SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA). Prior art: Quickstrom (PLDI 2022) applies LTL to web app testing externally; Comb's temporal assertions are embedded in the component model as graph nodes, with three operators: `eventually`, `always`, and `next`.

The `within N` value counts **trigger evaluations** (simulation ticks), not wall-clock time. This ensures assertions behave identically regardless of clock speed.

```sv
// "after request rises, grant must follow within 5 ticks"
assert temporal @(posedge bus_request)
  eventually(bus_grant) within 5;

// "bus_grant must stay true for 3 ticks after bus_busy rises"
assert temporal @(posedge bus_busy)
  always(bus_grant) within 3;

// "after submit, show result on next tick"
assert temporal @(posedge submitted)
  next(showResult) within 0;
```

Assertion lifecycle events (armed, passed, failed) are recorded in the waveform viewer as colored overlays — green for passed, red for failed, amber for pending.

---

## Module Composition

```sv
module Child {
  input label: string = "hello";
  output clicks: int = 0;

  always @(click) {
    clicks <= clicks + 1;
  }

  view {
    <button @click=click>{label} ({clicks})</button>
  }
}

module App {
  signal childClicks: int = 0;

  view {
    <Child label="Click me" clicks:={childClicks} />
    <p>Total: {childClicks}</p>
  }
}
```

`input` — read-only inside the child, set by the parent via attributes. `output` — writable by the child, readable by the parent. `:=` binds an output back to a parent signal (bidirectional wiring). Multiple modules compile together — the compiler builds a cross-module registry for verification.

Note: directional ports have prior art (Angular `@Input`/`@Output` since 2016, Elm ports). The value here is the integration with the `__graph` artifact for static analysis, not the ports themselves.

---

## Design Tokens

```sv
token primary: color = "#0052CC";
token radius: length = "8px";
```

A token is simultaneously a reactive signal and a CSS custom property (`--primary`, `--radius`). Changing the signal value at runtime updates the custom property. Use in styles via `var(--primary)`.

---

## Scoped Styles

```sv
style {
  .btn { background: var(--primary); padding: 8px; border-radius: var(--radius); }
  .label { font-weight: 600; }
}
```

Class names are auto-scoped per module using a deterministic hash (e.g. `.btn` becomes `.btn_a1b2c`). Styles are injected as a `<style>` element at mount time.

---

## Propagator Networks

Bidirectional constraints using cells and propagators.

### Cells

```sv
cell r: int = 255;
cell g: int = 0;
cell b: int = 128;
cell hex: string = "#ff0080";
```

Cells are like signals but support merge semantics — multiple writers converge rather than conflict.

### Constraints *(partially implemented)*

> The `constraint` keyword parses and compiles, but end-to-end compilation is being hardened. The runtime API (`createCell`, `createPropagator`) is fully functional.

```sv
constraint rgbToHex {
  (r, g, b) => { hex <= rgbToHex(r, g, b); }
  (hex) => { r <= hexToR(hex); g <= hexToG(hex); b <= hexToB(hex); }
}
```

Information flows in any direction — edit RGB, hex updates; edit hex, RGB updates. The propagator network resolves without infinite loops.

Prior art: Sussman & Radul (2009) is the theoretical foundation. dthompson/Spritely (FOSDEM 2026) built a working propagator-based FRP for web UI in Scheme/WASM. Comb's contribution is compiling constraint blocks from a DSL with static analysis and `__graph` integration.

---

## Enums

```sv
enum Phase { Red, Green, Yellow }
```

Used for FSM states. Enum values are available as `Phase.Red`, `Phase.Green`, etc.

---

## Type System

Type annotations are parsed and checked by `verify.ts`. Type mismatches produce **warnings** (not errors), allowing incremental adoption. The checker infers expression types (`inferExprType`) and validates compatibility (`typeCompatible`).

```sv
// Basic type annotations — checked at compile time (warnings on mismatch)
signal count: int = 0;
signal name: string = "";
signal active: bool = true;
signal price: float = 9.99;
```

### Planned type system extensions

The following extensions are domain-specific and not yet implemented:

```sv
// Range types
signal opacity: float(0.0..1.0) = 1.0;
signal temperature: int(-40..125) = 20;

// Unknown state (HDL-inspired X-value)
signal data: X | User;  // starts unresolved, compiler forces handling

// Exhaustive enum matching
match phase {
  Phase.Red => { ... }
  Phase.Green => { ... }
  Phase.Yellow => { ... }
  // compile error if not exhaustive
}
```

Prior art for unknown state: Solid's `createResource` handles async `T | undefined`, Leptos uses `Option<T>`. What's different: X-state applied to all signals with propagation semantics (X in any input → X output).

---

## Functions

### Built-in Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `str(x)` | Convert to string |
| `int(x)` | Convert to integer |
| `len(x)` | Length of string or array |
| `contains(s, sub)` | Check if string contains substring |
| `append(arr, item)` | Append item to array |
| `floor(x)` | Round down (`Math.floor`) |
| `round(x)` | Round to nearest (`Math.round`) |
| `min(a, b)` | Minimum of two values |
| `max(a, b)` | Maximum of two values |
| `abs(x)` | Absolute value |
| `reduce(arr, fn, init)` | Array reduce |
| `slice(arr, start)` | Array slice |
| `edgeCount(expr)` | Reactive count of posedge firings (no manual counter needed) |
| `negedgeCount(expr)` | Reactive count of negedge firings |
| `changeCount(signal)` | Reactive count of value changes (any value, not just boolean) |

Browser globals are also available: `fetch`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`, `console.log`, `JSON.parse`, `JSON.stringify`, `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, `Math.random`.

### Custom Functions

```sv
fn clamp(value: int, min: int, max: int) -> int {
  value < min ? min : value > max ? max : value;
}

fn formatPrice(amount: float) -> string {
  "$" + str(round(amount * 100) / 100);
}
```

Functions are defined with `fn name(params) -> returnType { body }`. The return type is optional. The last expression in the body is the implicit return value (like Rust). Explicit `return expr;` is also supported.

### Method Calls

Array and string methods work as method calls:

```sv
comb names = users.map(|u| u.name);
comb active = users.filter(|u| u.active);
comb found = items.find(|item| item.id == targetId);
comb csv = names.join(", ");
comb hasAdmin = users.some(|u| u.role == "admin");
```

Supported methods include: `map`, `filter`, `find`, `findIndex`, `some`, `every`, `includes`, `indexOf`, `join`, `flat`, `sort`, `reverse`, `push`, `pop`, `trim`, `split`, `replace`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `substring`, `charAt`.

---

## String Templates

```sv
comb greeting = `Hello, ${name}! You have ${count} items.`;
comb statusMsg = `Price: $${str(round(price * 100) / 100)}`;
```

Backtick strings with `${expr}` interpolation, compiled to JS template literals.

---

## Destructuring

```sv
always @(processData) {
  const { name, email } = userData;
  const [first, ...rest] = items;
  displayName <= name;
}
```

Object and array destructuring with `const`. Supports aliases (`{ key: alias }`) and rest patterns (`...rest`).

---

## Try/Catch

```sv
always @(submit) {
  try {
    result <= processForm(data);
  } catch (e) {
    error <= "Something went wrong";
  }
}
```

---

## Async Blocks

```sv
always @(loadUsers) {
  loading <= true;
  async {
    const response = await fetch("/api/users");
    const data = await response.json();
    users <= data;
    loading <= false;
  } catch {
    error <= "Failed to load";
    loading <= false;
  }
}
```

`async { }` blocks run asynchronously — the always block returns immediately and the async body executes in the background. Signal writes inside async blocks trigger new simulation cycles when they resolve. `await` is only valid inside async blocks.

### CDC Async Boundary Analysis

The compiler performs static analysis on async blocks, inspired by Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) analysis in hardware design. Three warnings:

| Warning | What it catches |
|---|---|
| Unsynchronized async write | Signal written in `async {}` but read synchronously by a comb without a loading guard |
| Race condition | Two or more `async {}` blocks write the same signal |
| Missing error handling | `async {}` block writes signals but has no `catch` block |

Taint propagation is **transitive** — if comb B reads async-tainted signal A, and comb C reads B, then C is also flagged. The analysis uses fixed-point iteration over the comb dependency graph.

---

## Component Children / Slots

```sv
module Card {
  input title: string = "";
  view {
    <div class="card">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <div class="card-body">
        <slot />
      </div>
    </div>
  }
}

module App {
  view {
    <Card title="My Card">
      <p>Child content goes here</p>
    </Card>
  }
}
```

Components accept child content via `<slot />`. Parent content between `<Component>` tags is passed to the child and rendered at the slot position.

---

## Form Elements

All form elements support `@bind` for two-way binding:

```sv
<input @bind=name />
<textarea @bind=description></textarea>
<select @bind=category>
  <option value="a">Option A</option>
  <option value="b">Option B</option>
</select>
<input type="checkbox" @bind=agreed />
<input type="radio" name="size" value="small" @bind=selectedSize />
```

The compiler detects the element type and uses the appropriate property (`value` vs `checked`) and event (`input` vs `change`).

---

## The `__graph` Artifact

Every `.comb` file compiles to JavaScript that exports `__graph` — a JSON-serializable static dependency graph containing every node (signal, comb, event, view binding, assertion) and every edge (data flow, trigger, write).

No other framework emits this as a build artifact (see docs/research/honest-prior-art.md for details).

Each node carries metadata:
- `valueType` — `'bool'`, `'int'`, `'float'`, `'string'`, or enum name
- `states` — finite state space when bounded (e.g. `['true','false']` for bool, `['Phase.Red','Phase.Green','Phase.Yellow']` for enum, `['0','1','2','3']` for bounded int with guard analysis)
- `expr` — assertion expression text for assert nodes

The graph also includes an `enums` map with all enum definitions and their variants.

This single data structure powers:

- **Circuit Visualization** — render the reactive topology as a live diagram
- **Circuit Diff** — compare `__graph` across two versions to detect topology changes
- **Graph-Directed Auto-Testing** — `runAutoTest()` reads the graph to discover inputs, drive state coverage, and track results
- **State Space Inference** — compiler analyzes write patterns and guard conditions to compute bounded state spaces
- **Waveform Debugger** — signal hierarchy, assertion overlays, cross-signal search
- **Runtime Overlay** — static graph merged with live signal values via `loadStaticGraph()`

---

## The DES Execution Model

The runtime uses a `SimulationEngine` with delta cycles (implemented in `src/runtime/signals.ts`).

```
Event enters → Delta 0: combinational logic (combs) settles
             → Delta 1: non-blocking assignments (<=) applied
             → Delta 2: new combinational changes settle
             → ...repeat until quiescent...
             → DOM commit: only after full stabilization
```

Delta cycles give formal guarantees: combs always see consistent state, concurrent always blocks execute deterministically, DOM updates only after stabilization. Standard topological sorting (Solid, Preact) is a single pass; delta cycles are multi-pass.

**Non-blocking assignment (`<=`):** Inside `always @(posedge/negedge)` blocks, all `<=` writes are deferred until the block completes. This means all reads see **pre-update values** — you don't need manual snapshots. The compiler emits `deferredBatch()` which sets `engine.evaluating = true` during execution, causing all signal writes to be queued for the next delta cycle instead of applying immediately.

**Fast path optimization:** When the dependency graph is a pure feed-forward chain (no feedback edges), the engine detects this statically and collapses the multi-pass delta cycle into a single topological pass — identical cost to Solid/Preact for the common case. The full delta cycle machinery only activates when feedback edges are present.

**Oscillation detection:** The compiler statically warns when an `always` block's sensitivity list creates a circular dependency (writing to a signal that feeds back into the same block's inputs). At runtime, if a delta cycle exceeds the iteration limit, the engine reports which signals are oscillating — listing their names and alternating values — rather than silently diverging or throwing an opaque error.

---

## Testing

### __test() — Headless signal access

Every compiled module exports `__test()` for headless testing without a DOM:

```javascript
const t = __test();
t.signals.username.set("alice");
assert(t.combs.usernameValid() === true);
t.dispose();
```

### runAutoTest() — Graph-directed coverage

The generic auto-test framework reads `__graph` and covers the state space automatically:

```javascript
import { runAutoTest, renderAutoTestResult } from '../runtime/index.js';

const result = runAutoTest(__graph, circuit, 'MyModule');
// result.percentage      → 100 (all bounded states covered)
// result.inputsDriven    → ['tick', 'p1_piece', ...]
// result.clocksDriven    → ['tick']
// result.signalCoverage  → per-signal visited states
```

Algorithm:
1. Find bounded signals (nodes with `states[]` in `__graph`)
2. Find root signals (no incoming edges — drivable inputs)
3. Find clocks (signals feeding posedge sensitivity blocks)
4. Drive each root through all states via `setValue()`
5. Tick clocks to propagate effects
6. Track which states each signal reached

Works for **any** compiled module with zero module-specific logic.

### CoverageCollector — Runtime instrumentation

The runtime automatically tracks:
- **Toggle coverage** — `recordToggle()` for boolean signals, combs, and cells
- **FSM transition coverage** — `recordTransition()` for enum-typed signals

No manual instrumentation needed — the `createSignal` and `createComb` primitives call these automatically when values change.

### CLI test runner

```bash
npx tsx src/cli/test.ts examples/registration.comb
```

Instantiates the module headlessly, generates inputs, evaluates assertions, reports coverage.

---

## CLI Tools

### Topology Diff

```bash
comb diff old.comb new.comb
```

Compares the `__graph` topology of two `.comb` files and reports added/removed/changed nodes and edges. Useful for reviewing how a refactor affected the reactive dependency graph.

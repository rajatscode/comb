# Comb

**A discrete event simulator for user interfaces.**

Comb is an experimental UI framework whose runtime is a discrete event simulation kernel — not a virtual DOM diffing engine, not a microtask-based signal graph, but a simulator with formal time, delta cycles, and edge-triggered sensitivity. You write `.comb` files; the compiler extracts a static circuit topology (`__graph`) and emits JavaScript targeting the simulation runtime.

The question Comb asks is not "what should the UI look like?" but **"what are the signals, what are the dependencies between them, and what events drive state transitions?"** — the same question a chip designer asks about a circuit.

> **Status:** Research prototype. The compiler, runtime, DES execution model (delta cycles), edge-triggered sensitivity, type system (warnings), and temporal assertions are all implemented and working. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Landing page + demos at localhost:3000
```

Playground at [localhost:3000/playground.html](http://localhost:3000/playground.html) — compiles `.comb` in the browser, no server round-trips.

## The Language

```sv
module Counter {
  signal count: int = 0;

  comb label = "Count: " + str(count);
  comb doubled = count * 2;

  always @(increment) {
    count <= count + 1;
  }

  always @(reset) {
    count <= 0;
  }

  view {
    <div class="counter">
      <h1>Comb Counter</h1>
      <p class="display">{label}</p>
      <p class="detail">doubled = {doubled}</p>
      <div class="controls">
        <button @click=increment>+</button>
        <button @click=reset>reset</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  }
}
```

### SystemVerilog Heritage

The syntax borrows from SystemVerilog intentionally — not as decoration, but because the HDL execution model maps onto UI problems in ways that standard reactive frameworks don't.

| Comb | SystemVerilog | What it means |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `signal` | `reg` | Mutable state that persists across events |
| `comb` | `always_comb` / `assign` | Derived value — pure function of signals, auto-recomputes |
| `always @(event)` | `always_ff @(posedge clk)` | Event-triggered state transition |
| `<=` | Non-blocking assign | Scheduled for end of current delta — batched, deterministic |
| `cell` | Latch | Merge-semantic value for propagator networks |
| `constraint` | Bidirectional wire | Propagator clause: information flows in any direction |
| `view { }` | Module ports | DOM output with fine-grained reactive bindings |
| `input` / `output` | Port | Directional module composition |

### Edge-triggered sensitivity

```sv
// Fires on transition, not on value
always @(posedge loading) { showSpinner(); }
always @(negedge loading) { fadeInContent(); }
```

### Temporal assertions

```sv
// SVA-inspired invariants over time
assert temporal @(posedge submitted)
  eventually(showSuccess || showError) within 5s;
```

### Planned syntax (not yet implemented)

```sv
// Unknown state — signal starts unresolved, compiler forces handling
signal data: X | User;
```

## What's Genuinely Novel

We did the research. Here's what holds up, what doesn't, and what we're building toward.

### Novel (no prior art found)

**Discrete event simulation as UI execution model.** No web framework uses a formal DES loop with delta cycles and simulation time. DES libraries exist (SIM.JS, SimScript) but for simulation workloads, not UI rendering. Jane Street's Bonsai is the most sophisticated graph-based reactive UI engine, but it's incremental computation, not DES. This is the core thesis.

**Static `__graph` artifact as compile output.** The compiler emits a JSON dependency graph alongside the JS. No framework does this. Marko does cross-file reactive analysis internally but doesn't expose it. Svelte builds an internal dep graph but doesn't emit it. Angular's Signal Graph is runtime-only. The `__graph` enables topology diffing, static analysis, and CI integration that runtime-only graphs can't.

### Novel in formulation (prior art for mechanism, not for DSL integration)

**Edge-triggered sensitivity as language syntax.** The mechanism exists — MobX's `when()` fires once when a predicate becomes true, RxJS's `pairwise()` detects transitions, Vue's `watch()` gives `(newValue, oldValue)`. But no framework offers `@(posedge x)` / `@(negedge x)` as a first-class compiled language construct. Comb compiles and runs edge-triggered blocks end-to-end. The value is in making edge detection declarative and compiler-verified, not in inventing edge detection.

**Propagator networks compiled from DSL.** David Thompson (Spritely project) built a working propagator-based FRP for web UI, presented at FOSDEM 2026. Sussman and Radul's 2009 work is the theoretical foundation. Cassowary.js handles layout constraints. What doesn't exist: a framework that compiles `constraint { }` blocks from a DSL into propagator networks with static analysis and graph artifact integration.

**Temporal assertions embedded in component model.** Quickstrom (Wickstrom, PLDI 2022) applies LTL to web application testing — it's real, published, peer-reviewed. The difference: Quickstrom is an external testing tool that observes the DOM from outside. Comb's temporal assertions live inside the component as graph nodes, running as development-time invariants with three operators (`eventually`, `always`, `next`) — closer to SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) than to property-based testing.

**Universal unknown state with propagation.** Solid's `createResource` returns `T | undefined` until resolved. Leptos uses `Option<T>`. React Suspense makes loading implicit. What's different: applying X-state to *all* signals (not just async resources) with HDL-style propagation semantics — if any input is unknown, the output is unknown, and the compiler forces you to handle it.

### Not novel (stop claiming these)

- **Fine-grained reactivity** — SolidJS, Preact Signals
- **Compiler-verified dependencies** — Svelte, React Compiler, Marko
- **Reactive graph visualization** — Angular DevTools Signal Graph, SolidJS devtools, NoFlo
- **Directional ports** — Angular `@Input`/`@Output` since 2016, Elm ports
- **Waveform debugging** — Redux DevTools with a different skin

## The DES Execution Model

When an event fires (user click, fetch response, timer), the simulator runs a deterministic loop:

```
Event enters → Delta 0: combinational logic (combs) settles
             → Delta 1: non-blocking assignments (<=) applied
             → Delta 2: if new combinational changes, settle again
             → ...repeat until quiescent...
             → DOM commit: only after full stabilization
```

The runtime implements this via the `SimulationEngine` in `src/runtime/signals.ts`, using real delta cycles. This gives formal guarantees that microtask-based frameworks can't:
- **Combs always see consistent state** — no reading a half-updated signal graph
- **Concurrent always blocks execute deterministically** — no surprises from effect ordering
- **DOM updates only after stabilization** — no partial renders, no glitch frames

The practical difference from topological sorting (what Solid/Preact do): topological sort is a single pass. Delta cycles allow multi-pass stabilization where sequential logic (`<=`) creates new combinational dependencies that need another settle pass.

## Features (Implemented)

- **DES execution model** — `SimulationEngine` with delta cycles for deterministic multi-pass stabilization
- **Edge-triggered sensitivity** — `@(posedge x)` / `@(negedge x)` compiles and runs end-to-end
- **Type system** — type checking with warnings (not errors) via `verify.ts`
- **Temporal assertions** — `assert temporal @(trigger) eventually/always/next(prop) within duration`
- **Static `__graph` artifact** — circuit topology extracted at compile time
- **Circuit topology diffing** — diff two `__graph`s to see what changed between versions
- **Auto-derived testing** — `__test()` export gives headless signal/comb access
- **Propagator networks** — bidirectional constraints via cells + propagators
- **Compiler-verified sensitivity lists** — wrong deps = compile error
- **Assertions as graph nodes** — `assert valid: condition;` visible in circuit
- **Design tokens** — `token accent: color = "#4a9eff"` → CSS custom property in the graph
- **Module composition** — directional ports with `input`/`output`
- **Scoped styles** — per-module CSS with auto-generated scope hashes
- **Browser-portable compiler** — runs entirely in the browser for the playground
- **Readable generated code** — inspect exactly what your `.comb` compiles to

## Architecture

### Compiler (`src/core/`)

Pure TypeScript, zero dependencies, runs in the browser. `compile(source) → { js, graph, errors }`.

- **Lexer** — Hand-written tokenizer with JSX-mode switching for `view {}` blocks
- **Parser** — Recursive descent + Pratt expression parsing. Context-sensitive `<=`
- **Verify** — Symbol table, undefined reference detection, circular dep detection, sensitivity list validation
- **CodeGen** — Emits readable JS targeting the runtime API
- **Graph Builder** — Extracts `__graph` with typed nodes, edges, and view-effect metadata

### Runtime (`src/runtime/`)

- **Signals** — Push-pull reactivity (signals push dirty flags, combs pull on read)
- **Cells** — Merge-semantic values for propagator networks
- **Propagators** — Directional constraint clauses
- **CircuitGraph** — Queryable data structure. Static graph loaded from `__graph`, runtime overlays live values
- **Effects** — Auto-tracking side effects for DOM updates
- **Batch** — Non-blocking assignment scheduling
- **DOM** — Fine-grained patching, no virtual DOM

### The `__graph` Pipeline

```
.comb → Compiler → __graph (JSON) → Circuit Visualizer
                                   → Topology Differ
                                   → Test Harness
                                   → Runtime (merges static + live values)
```

The `__graph` is the single data structure that every tool shares. The visualizer doesn't scrape the DOM — it reads `__graph`. The differ doesn't compare JS output — it compares `__graph`s. The test harness walks the `__graph` to find signals and combs.

## Theoretical Foundations

- **SystemVerilog** — Execution model and mental model: signals, combinational logic, non-blocking assignment, sensitivity lists, assertions
- **Sussman & Radul (2009)** — Propagator networks: cells + propagators = bidirectional constraint solving
- **SolidJS** — Fine-grained signal primitives and dependency tracking
- **Bonsai (Jane Street)** — Two-phase architecture: static graph construction + runtime execution
- **Svelte** — Compiler-based reactivity: shift work from runtime to build time
- **Esterel** — Synchronous reactive language proving the same model targets both UI and hardware
- **Quickstrom (PLDI 2022)** — LTL applied to web application testing (prior art for temporal assertions)
- **dthompson / Spritely (FOSDEM 2026)** — Propagator-based FRP for web UI (prior art for propagator UI)

## Known Limitations

- No source maps
- List rendering in `@for` uses full re-render (no keyed reconciliation)
- No SSR
